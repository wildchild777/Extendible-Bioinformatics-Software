2-3th October 
Set up git repo, started structing my project plan, did intial reading in bioinfomratics.

4th October

Read about protein sequencing, DNA synthesis which is how later on CS and biologists came together to create this field of bioinformatics, since this created a lot of data which had to be analysed. This helped me start my abstract of the project paper. 

5th October 

Reading a Research paper that has helped me understand the evolution of protein to DNA analysis, which has helped me refine my abstract until now. Plan is to finish it and majority of my abstract by tomorrow. 

7th October 

On my way to finish the research paper i was reading on the 5th, went on a tangent of reading 2 more research papers which were informative but not too useful for abstract, hoping to finish abstract tomorrow and start working on timeline and risk mitigations.

9th October 

Finally finished my abstract and got my citations in, going to start working on the timeline and risk mitigations.

11th Ocotber

Reading through SE books to plan out my code - Hope to have a rough outline by Wednesday to discuss with supervisor on Thursday

Looked at different biological sets to use and their respective clustering that can be used - going to use gse10072 for the first biological
dataset - and implement k means clustering on it.
