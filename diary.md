2-3th October 
Set up git repo, started structing my project plan, did intial reading in bioinfomratics.

Read about protein sequencing, DNA synthesis which is how later on CS and biologists came together to create this field of bioinformatics, since this created a lot of data which had to be analysed. This helped me start my abstract of the project paper.
