2-3th October 
Set up git repo, started structing my project plan, did intial reading in bioinfomratics.

4th October

Read about protein sequencing, DNA synthesis which is how later on CS and biologists came together to create this field of bioinformatics, since this created a lot of data which had to be analysed. This helped me start my abstract of the project paper. 

5th October 

Reading a Research paper that has helped me understand the evolution of protein to DNA analysis, which has helped me refine my abstract until now. Plan is to finish it and majority of my abstract by tomorrow. 

7th October 

On my way to finish the research paper i was reading on the 5th, went on a tangent of reading 2 more research papers which were informative but not too useful for abstract, hoping to finish abstract tomorrow and start working on timeline and risk mitigations.
