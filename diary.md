2-3th October 
Set up git repo, started structing my project plan, did intial reading in bioinfomratics.

4th October

Read about protein sequencing, DNA synthesis which is how later on CS and biologists came together to create this field of bioinformatics, since this created a lot of data which had to be analysed. This helped me start my abstract of the project paper. 

5th October 

Reading a Research paper that has helped me understand the evolution of protein to DNA analysis, which has helped me refine my abstract until now. Plan is to finish it and majority of my abstract by tomorrow. 

7th October 

On my way to finish the research paper i was reading on the 5th, went on a tangent of reading 2 more research papers which were informative but not too useful for abstract, hoping to finish abstract tomorrow and start working on timeline and risk mitigations.

9th October 

Finally finished my abstract and got my citations in, going to start working on the timeline and risk mitigations.

11th Ocotber 

Finished my plan and submitted 

28th October 

Reading through SE books to plan out my code - Hope to have a rough outline by Wednesday to discuss with supervisor on Thursday

11th November

Looked at different biological sets to use and their respective clustering that can be used - going to use gse10072 for the first biological
dataset - and implement k means clustering on it.

12th 

Tried to find datasets that i could use - but ended up starting from the ground up and reading a bit of lit before i start my project, there are a lot of things that i dont understand that i hope i can once i am through with the lit - plug in system, datasets for bioinformatics, software engineering principles. 

I started reading building bioinformatics solution(by conrad bessant et al) to understand how the data is stored and their relevant metadata, this book teaches us how a bioinformatics software is created from scratch - hopefully when i am through with the relevant chappters i can have more confidence.

15th-18th 

Reading on lit, the design pattern help understand what i could implement and working on the parser for a soft file since its one of the harder files to parse, this will give me a good grasp for future file parsing.

19th november 

Worked on the SoftParser class so it can parse SOFT data files - in progress

2nd decemeber 

Finished SoftParser class, now it can successfully parse a SOFT file, was working on a bug 21-24 which caused the parser to take in unnecessary lines.

3rd december 

Worked on making suplementary classes for my K means clustering, we can turn our parser output into it's respective classes so it can be encapsulated well, this will help for our code to be cleaner and more useable. 

Worked on eucledian distance - i am using the eucledian because the implementation is pretty straightforward.

Worked on centroid representation for our k means - so our clusters can be in the same dimension and converge faster

4th december 

Our softparser was giving out a very complicated data structure which didn't align well with good perormance and optamization, started working on refactoring that.

Worked on centroid generation, and added SE elements into code for better SE practise(Strategy)

5th december 

Worked on K means more - for random centroid generation

6th-8th decemebr 

Finished working on K means - assign, average and the other methods

9th-11th 

refactoring SoftPArser for a more apropriate data structure.

==break=== 
jan 18-30: project was revisited to improve redability, there were a lot of intilisation mistakes - which were then taken care of

jan 31 - feb 6: Design of the JavaFx interface with prototyping, SOLID principles were visited to see if data persistence was possible

feb 7 - feb 13: We wont be having data persistence since its not paramount, new UML ddesiging takes place, i have to look into introducting design patterns since the codebase needs to be modular.

feb 13- feb 22 : New UML with strategy, and observer were created and had a meeting with supervisor discussing the same.

feb 26- feb 28: old classes were brushed up, new unit tests for everything and addition of new classes(cluserting) to meet spec.

march 4 - march 11: Ran into javaFx compatability issue, turns out my JavaFx files weren't compatible with Scenebuilder, the plugin used by eclipse wan't helped had to do a clean rebuild of everything, and redownload all the needed files, during this time i was working on the UI on a different package for this project but forgot to keep it tracked

march 13- march 20: Extensive changes of UML and discussion with supervisor about the same, got the interface checked and got feedback, working on the same.

march 24th- April 1: Working on Code, implementing design patterns for the needed Classes(clustering - view -parsings), a lot of refactoring as classes evolve.

April 1 - April 11 : Started working on Final report submission alongside the code, code is slowing being generalsied with a lot of focus on plug-ins, design patterns

April 11 - April: Final touches on Plug-in a lot of manual testing for JavaFx intergration. UML upgradation and first major release of software and lock down of the UML for the same, final report comes to an end and submission.
